Have you ever wanted to make your own? This step-by-step guide will show you how to make a fountain pen from scratch!  Fountain pens are a great way to show your personality, style, and make your writing more enjoyable.  ## What Is a Fountain Pen?  A fountain pen is a type of pen that uses liquid ink instead of oil-based ink, which is often used in ballpoint pens.  The ink is stored in a reservoir inside the pen, and a feed system allows the ink to flow to the nib.  Fountain pens can be found in various styles and have price points, from inexpensive plastic pens to luxury gold-plated models.  ## The Different Styles and Designs of Fountain Pens  Fountain pens come in various styles and designs, from simple plastic pens to luxury gold-plated models.  Some are produced in a large quantity while others can be custom-designed. When producing a fountain pen, the maker must decide on the pen's unique features and who the target audience is.  The styles include vintage, modern, and executive. The designs can be plain or elaborate.  Many fountain pens are designed to have a classic look that never goes out of style. Others are more contemporary in their design and may incorporate new materials or innovative features.  ## Things to Consider When Making Your Own Fountain Pen  When making your fountain pen, there are a few things you need to take into account. Some of which includes:  ### Type of Ink  The type of ink you use is essential. Fountain pen inks come in various colors and thickness, so it's vital to choose an ink compatible with your specific pen. You can also buy ink that is designed for calligraphy or drawing.  ### Nib Material  The material of the nib is also essential. Nibs can be made from various materials, including gold, steel, and titanium. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's vital to choose a nib compatible with the type of ink you plan to use.  ### Feed System  The feed system controls the flow of ink from the reservoir to the nib. There are a variety of feed systems available, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.  ### Barrel Type  The barrel refers to the body of the pen, and it can be made from a variety of materials. The most common materials are plastic, metal, and wood.  ### Clip  The clip is an optional feature that can be added to the barrel of the pen. Clips are typically made from metal or plastic and can be used to secure the pen to a pocket or notebook.  ### Filling System  The filling system is what holds the ink in the reservoir. There are various filing systems available, including cartridge/converter, piston, and vacuum.  Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's crucial to choose a filling system compatible with the kind of ink you plan to use.  ## Raw Materials Needed to Make a Fountain Pen  The raw materials needed to make a fountain pen include:    * Pen barrel   * Ink reservoir   * Nib   * Feed system   * Clip and cap   * Screws and other hardware   * Bottle of ink  These materials can be found at your local stationery store or online.  ## How to Make a Fountain Pen  Now that you know what a fountain pen is and what materials you need to make one, it's time to get started!  ### Step #1: Choose a Style for Your Pen  The first step is to choose a style for your pen. There are three basic styles: vintage, modern, and executive.    * Vintage pens are made from metal or wood and have a classic look   * Modern pens are usually made from plastic or metal and have a more contemporary look   * Executive pens are typically made from wood or metal and have a professional look  ### Step #2: Choose Your Pen Barrel Material  The second step is to choose the material of your pen barrel. The most common materials are plastic, metal, and wood. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages.  Plastic is the most affordable option, not to mention it's easy to work with. Metal pens are more durable, but they can be more challenging to construct. Wood is an attractive option that offers a unique look, but it's the most difficult to work with.  ### Step #3: Cut the Pen Barrel to Size  Once you've chosen your material, it's time to cut the pen barrel to size. If you’re using plastic or metal, you can use a saw or rotary tool to cut the barrel to the desired length.  If you're using wood, you'll need to drill a hole through the center of the barrel before cutting it to size.  ### Step #4: Drill the Ink Reservoir Hole  Next, you need to drill a hole for the ink reservoir. This hole needs to be large enough for the ink reservoir to fit snug inside.  Using a plastic or metal barrel, you can use a drill bit to create the hole. If you're using a wood barrel, you need to create a pilot hole before drilling the giant reservoir hole.  ### Step #5: Create the Feed System  The next step is to create the feed system. The most common type of feed system is the cartridge/converter.  To create this feed system, you'll need to first drill a hole in the barrel for the ink reservoir.  ### Step #6: Assemble the Ink Reservoir  The next step is to assemble the ink reservoir. You will need a glass bottle with a small opening, a funnel, and some tubing. Fill the glass bottle with ink, then use the funnel to pour it into the pen's barrel.  Next, take the tubing and insert one end into the barrel and the other into the ink reservoir. Make sure the tubing is long enough so that the ink can flow from the reservoir into the barrel.  ### Step #7: Attach the Clip and Cap  The next step is to attach the clip and cap. First, insert the screws into the pen barrel. Next, attach the clip and cap to the screws. Make sure the cap is snug so that it doesn't come off during use.  ### Step #8: Assemble the Nib  The final step is to assemble the nib. First, insert the nib into the pen barrel. Then, screw on the nib housing. Ensure the housing is tight so it doesn't become loose.  ### Step #9: Test Your Pen  Once you've assembled the pen, it's time to test it out! Fill the ink reservoir and write a few words to see how the pen works. If everything is working correctly, congratulations! You've just made your very own fountain pen.  If you're having trouble getting the ink to flow, try adjusting the nib housing or the tubing position.  The process used to make fountain pens at larger companies is generally more automated. These companies use specially tooled machines to mold the pen barrels, usually from molten plastic. These machines also stamp and crimp the metal parts, assemble the final product together, and even take care of the polishing and cleaning.  ## Conclusion  Overall, making a fountain pen is doable, but it can still be a bit of a hassle. It’s much easier to buy a premade fountain pen and start writing right away with less chance of any structural problems.  With a bit of practice, you'll be able to produce beautiful handwriting with your very own homemade (or premade) fountain pen!  __Prev Previous  Next __Next  ## More   **articles**  ###  Top 5 Fountain Pens with a Fine Point  March 9, 2023  ###  The 5 Best Fountain Pens to Gift in 2023  March 9, 2023  ###  What to Expect from Pilot Iroshizuku inks  March 9, 2023  ###  Asvine V169 Vacuum Filling Fountain Pen Review  March 9, 2023  Receive the latest news  ## Subscribe To Our Weekly Newsletter  Email Address  subscribe  ## Find Us Here  Facebook-f __ Twitter __ Linkedin-in __ Youtube __    * Privacy Policy   * Disclaimer   * Contact  ____ Menu    * Privacy Policy   * Disclaimer   * Contact  ## All Rights Reserved © 2022  Receive the latest news  ## Subscribe To Our Weekly Newsletter  Get notified about new articles  Email Address  subscribe   …\n",

If you don't have the carpentry tools or patience to tackle that project, you can make a simple pen out of many common materials, from clay to tail feathers.  ##  Steps  Method 1  Method 1 of 2:  ### Quick and Easy Pen Methods  Download Article    1. 1  **Shape a pen with polymer clay.** Take out a pen's ink cartridge and cut a bamboo skewer to the same length. Wipe the skewer with petroleum jelly and use it to pierce a small ball of polymer clay. Roll out the clay until it extends along the whole skewer, seal it over one end, and bake according to clay's label instructions. Let cool 5–10 minutes, remove the skewer, then glue in the ink cartridge once the clay has cooled completely.[1] X Research source    2. 2  **Use a piece of cane.** A thin piece of bamboo is ideal, but any sturdy hollow cane will do. Cut off a cane segment underneath one joint, and just below the next. Drop an ink cartridge from an ordinary pen into the hollow end. Gradually make an angled cut into the solid end, until you can poke through with the ink cartridge tip. Seal the end with clay or putty to prevent ink leaking out.       * If the cartridge is too loose, hold it in with strong glue. If it's too long, hold it in place with tape.  Advertisement    3. 3  **Make a quill pen****.** Choose a large tail feather, and trim away enough feathers to comfortably hold the tip. Sand the tip smooth, then cut it away at a steep angle. To let the quill pick up ink, cut a slit from the tip inward, and chop off the extreme tip to make a flat edge.[2] X Research source       * For best results, before you begin cutting, soak the feather in hot water until it bends easily, then harden it again in hot sand.[3] X Research source  Advertisement  Method 2  Method 2 of 2:  ### Making a Quality Pen  Download Article    1. 1  **Purchase a pen kit.** You'll most likely have to place an online order, as these are difficult to find even in craft stores. These include the ink cartridge and metal pieces.       * See the Things You'll Need section below for additional tools before you buy. The same source may be able to sell you those tools.      * This guide will work for any type of pen kit. Rollerball pens are slightly easier to assemble, but twist pen kits are usually the cheapest option.[4] X Research source    2. 2  **Cut or purchase a pen blank.** A pen blank is just a rectangular block with a hole drilled through the center, usually made from wood or Corian. You can practice on homemade scrap lumber blanks, then move on to pre-cut blanks with more attractive wood and \"stabilized\" treatment for a better fit.       * Line up the two brass tubes from your pen kit. Cut the blank a bit longer than this length. The other dimensions don't matter, as long as the blank is significantly larger than the desired pen size. A 5\" x ½\" x ½\" (12.75 x 1.25 x 1.25 cm) blank should fit most pen kits.[5] X Research source    3. 3  **Saw the blank apart.** Line up the brass tubes next to your blank. Cut the blank into segments, each one slightly longer than a single brass tube.       * Most pen kits come with two brass tubes, but some use three. These may be different lengths, so use a different tube for each measurement.      * Draw a pencil line across the blanks so you can easily line up the grain.    4. 4  **Drill the pen blank.** If you cut your own blank, hold each part in a drill press and drill through the center. The drill bit must match the outer diameter of the brass tubes in your pen kit. Drill slowly, in ½\" (1.25 cm) increments, to avoid fracturing the material.[6] X Research source Set the drill press' depth stop so the point just barely touches the opposite side. If it emerges fully, it will often \"blow out\" the whole blank, making you start again.[7] X Research source Saw off the tip of the blank so the hole goes straight through.       * The most common sizes are 7mm (roughly J bit or 9/32\") and 8mm (roughly O or 5/16\"). If using imperial drill bits, you may want to test on scrap wood first to find the best fit. A slightly loose fit should turn out fine if you use extra glue.[8] X Research source    5. 5  **Sand and glue in the brass tubes.** Scuff the exterior of the brass tubes with rough sandpaper, about 120 grit. Optionally, plug the end with Play-Do or dental wax to avoid getting glue inside the tube.[9] X Research source Apply glue and stick each brass tube into the blank of the same length. Wear gloves to minimize cleanup.       * Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue and 5-minute epoxy are popular choices.      * If you use polyurethane glue, wait until the final stage, when you're ready to assemble. This glue foams up as it cures, which can ruin the fit. (This is a possibility with all glues, but most pen makers prefer the convenience of gluing at this stage instead of leaving the tubes loose.)[10] X Research source    6. 6  **Square the ends with a pen mill.** Wait for the glue to cure, according to the glue's label instructions. Fit the pen mill rod into one of the tubes, and turn clockwise so the cutting edge squares the end. Repeat with each end of each blank, until every surface is flush with the end of the brass tube.       * Now's a good time to check the inside of the tubes for glue. Scrape it out using any tool.      * You can use a sanding jig instead, but it may take quite a bit of setup.[11] X Research source    7. 7  **Mount blanks and bushings on a mandrel.** Line up the pen blanks in the order they fit together, on the mandrel rod. Place a bushing in between them, and another bushing on either end. Fit the two ends of the mandrel to hold the pen in place.       * Check the kit instructions for recommended bushing size.      * If you really don't want to buy the pen mandrel you can mount each blank separately on a 60º live center instead.[12] X Research source Shaping each piece separately will be much harder for a beginner, however.    8. 8  **Turn the pen on the lathe****.** Mount the mandrel onto your lathe. Shape the blank down to the diameter of the bushings, using gouges, skews, or any other lathe turning tools. Stop the lathe after the initial rough shaping, and loosen the mandrel nut and tailstock before you continue. These usually tighten during turning, which can lead to misshapen pens.[13] X Research source Continue turning until you've achieved any shape you like.       * If you don't have a lathe, mount a sanding drum onto your drill press and hold the blank against it. You'll have much less control, but no one wants to buy a $300 lathe for a $2 pen.    9. 9  **Sand off tool marks.** Remove the pen from the lathe. Sand the blanks with dry, 220 grit sandpaper. Repeat with 320, 400, and 600 grit to get a progressively smoother surface.       * There are plenty of variations on this exact sanding process, so don't feel that you have to use these exact grits. High-quality pens may be sanded up to 1200 grit at this stage, using mesh abrasive cloths.[14] X Research source    10. 10  **Apply a finish and sand again.** You can use any film finish, lacquer, or wood polish to give the pen a glossy, protective coating. Complete the blank by wetting it and sanding with finer grit sandpaper. Try polishing with 400 grit, 600, 800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2400, 3200, 3600, and 4000 (using abrasive meshe …\n",

How I Make Pens - Step By Step Instructions  #  How To Make A Pen, From Preparation To Assembly - Step by Step Instructions  Author: Timberbits  Date posted: 5 January 2020  Step by step instructions and videos on how I make a Baron II Pen.  This is how I make a Baron II Pen.  I can't stress enough the importance of grain matching your pens. It only take a few seconds during the blank preparation process and a few simple step to repetitively get the grains to match. I always get complimented by the gallery owners and jewellers on how the grain match up. It shows to your customers that the pen has been well made and that you have thought through the pen making process.  Step 1: Pen blanks - preparing them for the drill press.   Step 2: How I drill out my blanks to produce better grain matched pens.   Step 3: How I glue up and square the cheeks of the pen blanks.   Step 4: Rough turning the pen.   Step 5: Sanding the pen barrels.   Step 6: Applying 20 thin coats of CA as a finish.        Step 6A: Applying 20 thin coats of CA using Glen 20 as a finish.        Step 6B: Applying 20 thin coats of CA using the Super Tight Ass Method.   Step 7: Final buff to get a high gloss finish.   Step 8: Final work before assembly.   Step 9: The final step - assembly.  ## Step 1: Pen blanks - preparing them for the drill press.  In this video I prepare some blanks for some Barons for glue up.  The way I prepare my pen blanks is I always try to match the grain of the pens when I’m assembling my pens. I go through a few steps prior to cutting and drilling the pen blanks.    1. I mark the blanks where the cuts are to be made on the band saw (5 - 10mm longer than the brass tube length).   2. I mark a line to join the 2 halves of the blank so that when I put it on the lathe I can keep them in order.   3. I mark the type of pen that I am drilling and gluing the blank for.   4. I mark the short and the long side of the blank.   5. I give each pen blank a unique number so the two halve can be easily identified in the rare occasion I drop my draw of pen blanks and all the blanks get mixed up.   6. I then use the band saw to cut the blanks to the appropriate length.  Keeping the grain matched on the assembled pen is very important because it shows that you have taken the time and put the effort in to create a fine writing instrument. The gallery owners and especially the jewellers always comment on how my pens look like they have come from a single piece of wood. My reply is always “it looks like it came from a single piece of wood because it did come from a single piece.”  A few second invested prior to cutting and turning will pay dividends on your hand made fine writing instrument.  ## Step 2: How I drill out my blanks to produce better grain matched pens.  After cutting the blanks on the band saw, I line up the blanks and I start drilling the holes for the brass tubes. I always start with the larger diameter holes, that way if I stuff up, I can recover the other half for a smaller pen like the Sierra or Elegant Beauty.  When it comes to drilling out the blank, I always put the marked side with the center of the blank facing up on the press. The reason for this is because if there is a chip-out on the push through, we loose a bit on the end of the pen and not the centre of the pen. This helps with the grain match up on the pen. If we lose too much from the centre of the blank, the grains just don't look as good. I anticipate the chip-out, that is why I always allow the 5 - 10 mm so we don't waste the pen blanks.  The drill bit that I use is just a standard twist drill bit. I always sharpen my drill bit before a run of blanks. I use a Drill Doctor to give me a sharp cutting edge - the Drill Doctor is quick, in 30 seconds I have a nice sharp drill.  I don't use a brad point drill bit because because they are difficult to sharpen. Unless your a very skilled trained professional or have an expensive sharpening machine, their next to impossible to sharpen. The same is true with the parabolic dill bit. Parabolic bits also seem to flex and wobble very easily, the bit likes to follow the grain of the timber resulting in far higher stuff up when it comes to drilling the smaller sized blanks.  ## Step 3: How I glue up and square the cheeks of the pen blanks.  When gluing up, I set myself up over a rubbish bin – that way all the surplus glue drips into the bin rather than all over the floor. I use thick CA to glue my brass tubes into the pen blanks.  I prepare the tubes by sanding the brass tube with 80 grit sandpaper so there is a mechanical key for the glue to hold onto. I use the thick CA and squeeze a generous amount of it into the blank, and then I use a cotton bud to spread it evenly around the b …\n",

The production of green pens, such as branded eco-pens made from bamboo and recycled plastic materials, helps decrease plastic contamination in the environment and supports consumer responsibility.  The composition and advantages of recycled plastic pens, together with projections about forthcoming sustainable writing instruments, are examined in this article.  Table of Contents  Toggle    * The Importance of Sustainable Materials in Pen Production     * Sustainable materials used in pen production deliver these main advantages:   * Bamboo: A Renewable and Biodegradable Alternative     * Advantages of bamboo pens:   * Recycled Plastics: Giving Waste a Second Life     * The process of pen production uses recycled plastic in two ways:   * Other Eco-Friendly Materials Used in Green Pens     * Cornstarch-Based Bioplastics     * Recycled Paper and Cardboard     * Wood     * Metal   * The Future of Sustainable Pens   * Conclusion  ## The Importance of Sustainable Materials in Pen Production  Pens exist everywhere because they find use throughout schools, offices, and residential spaces. Many people fail to consider the environmental influence of pens. Widespread pen uses of virgin fossil-fuel-sourced plastics for their creation resulting in plastic contamination that harms both natural resources and humans. Alternative materials enable companies to reduce environmental damage by maintaining product utility.  ### Sustainable materials used in pen production deliver these main advantages:    * The use of recycled along with biodegradable resources reduces plastic waste, which prevents materials from reaching both oceans and landfills.    * The production of pens using sustainable materials leads to decreased carbon emissions compared to regular plastic manufacturing processes.    * Bamboo, as well as biodegradable materials from cornstarch molecules, offers renewable advantages thanks to its quick regrowth capability.  Environmental awareness among consumers has grown, so manufacturers now produce branded eco-pens, which also leads them to adopt sustainable manufacturing practices.  ## Bamboo: A Renewable and Biodegradable Alternative  Many modern pens, such as Save Your Ink, use bamboo as the primary sustainable material because of its ability to decompose naturally. Bamboo demonstrates faster growth than traditional plastics because it grows swiftly without needing pesticides or fertilizers as cultivation inputs.  ### Advantages of bamboo pens:    * Nowadays, bamboo displays rapid expansion capabilities, which make this resource highly sustainable.    * The decomposition process of bamboo occurs naturally, so the environment stays protected from deterioration.    * Bamboo pens endure well and demonstrate attractive features that attract environmentally aware buyers.    * Minimal factory requirements during bamboo pen production help reduce energy needs compared to making pens with plastic materials, thus minimizing the environmental effect.  The refillable ink cartridges that bamboo pens employ enable prolonged use and decrease the amount of waste produced by these pens.  ## Recycled Plastics: Giving Waste a Second Life  The production of eco-friendly pens heavily depends on recycled plastic as a principal raw material. The creation of sustainable pens through plastic waste management from bottles and containers and additional post-consumer products leads to both lower virgin plastic needs and less environmental contamination.  ### The process of pen production uses recycled plastic in two ways:    * Post-consumer plastic recycling prevents waste from entering landfills so it can get a second life instead of accumulating at landfills or in oceans.    * The manufacturing process of recycled plastic pens uses lower amounts of energy when compared to conventional plastic production.    * A circular economic system emerges when materials are reused consistently as part of the presented method.    * Recycled plastic pens retain their durability the same as standard plastic writing implements and simultaneously cut down on environmental consequences.  Nonetheless, these recycled plastic pens succeed as they lessen both plastic production requirements and the amount of waste in the environment because they persist despite their non-biodegradability attribute.  ## Other Eco-Friendly Materials Used in Green Pens  Various alternative materials apart from bamboo and recycled plastics have emerged for eco-friendly pens. The materials help create sustainable products that serve the various needs of environmentally conscious customers.  ### Cornstarch-Based Bioplastics  The emerging market of plastic products produced from cornstarch provides a potential replacement for standard plastics. Bioplastics made from cornstarch have the ability to decompose automatically when placed in composting environments, thus minimizing pollution.  ### Recycled Paper and Cardboard  Reclaimed paper and cardboard barrels in pens decrease plastic usage without affecting their efficient dimensions. After use, these pens become suitable for biodegradation and recycling.  ### Wood  Sustainable wood supplies serve as a plastic alternative because these pens degrade naturally over time. The environmental focus of users attracts them to pens equipped with rustic, natural designs.  ### Metal  Plastic pens created with recycled aluminum or stainless steel have excellent durability as well as reusability, though they remain non-biodegradable materials. Reusable metal pens function as a durable pen solution that substitutes traditional single-use plastic pens.  Pixabay  ## The Future of Sustainable Pens  Eco-friendly product demand growth creates favorable conditions for sustainable pens in the coming years. The following patterns will direct the path of environmentally friendly pens:    * The development of novel plant-based bioplastics and compostable products through scientific investigations will create better environmentally sustainable pen solutions.    * Refillable pen designs with modular elements help people maintain their writing instruments instead of throwing them away after a single usage, thus minimizing waste generation.    * Corporations are creating closed-loop recycling schemes that have dedicated take-back procedures for replenishing pens into new manufacturing products.  Business ventures now boost their sustainability branding through the selection of environmentally friendly pens as promotional items, which raises market demand for eco-friendly options.  ## Conclusion  The transition to manufacturing sustainable and reusable pens serves as a fundamental process to minimize plastic waste, together with its support for environmental responsibility. Three suitable options for environmentally friendly writing tools include bamboo, recycled plastics, and biodegradable alternatives.  Consumer selection of pens containing sustainable materials enables them to support environmental sustainability in long-term perspectives. The stationery industry will gradually adopt environmentally sustainable pen standards, which will emerge as the new standard writing tool.  ### More Reading  ## Post navigation  Previous Post  ### How Monsoon in India Creates Sustainable Ecosystems  Monsoon: An Obscure But Important Season The Monsoon is a season that does not…  Next Post  ### Emergency Tree Service: What to Do When a Tree Poses a Threat to Your Home  When a tree poses an immediate danger to your home, you need a reliable…  Search for: __Search  ### Categories  Categories Select Category Agriculture Animals Climate Change Eco Editorial Energy Environment Environmental Policy Garden and landscape Green Food Green Technology Green Tips Green Travel Health and Wellness Home Improvement Infographics Other Stories Pet Pollution Recycle Sustainability Toxics Uncategorized  ### Recent Posts    * Is Dumpster Diving Legal?

One such choice is the type of stationery we use. Traditional plastic stationery items, though convenient and affordable, contribute substantially to environmental degradation. In contrast, sustainable alternatives offer eco-friendly solutions that mitigate these negative impacts. This article delves into the differences between stationery options, highlighting waste statistics and relevant information to underscore the importance of making environmentally conscious choices.  * * *  **The Environmental Impact of Plastic Stationery**  Stationery items, including pens, rulers, and folders, are predominantly made from non-renewable resources such as petroleum. The production, use, and disposal of these items have several environmental repercussions:  1\\. **Non-Biodegradability:** Plastic materials can take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose. Consequently, discarded stationery accumulates in landfills and natural environments, contributing to long-term pollution.  2\\. **Resource Consumption:** The manufacturing of these products consumes significant amounts of fossil fuels and energy, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and depletion of natural resources.  3\\. Waste Generation: The stationery industry generates a substantial amount of plastic waste. For instance, in the United States alone, approximately 1.6 billion pens are purchased annually, many of which end up in landfills. In India, this number is estimated to be around 2.4 billion pens per year, with 91% of the waste generated not being recycled.  4\\. **Environmental Pollution:** Improper disposal of stationery leads to pollution in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Over 75% of marine debris along Australia’s coastline is composed of plastic, posing severe risks to marine life and ecosystems.  * * *  **Advantages of Sustainable Stationery**  Sustainable stationery encompasses products made from eco-friendly materials designed to minimise environmental impact. The benefits of opting for sustainable stationery include:  1\\. Reduced Environmental Footprint: Sustainable stationery is often made from recycled or renewable materials, such as recycled paper, bamboo, or biodegradable plastics, which significantly reduce resource consumption and waste generation.  2\\. **Biodegradability and Recyclability** : Many sustainable stationery products are designed to be biodegradable or easily recyclable, ensuring they do not persist in the environment for extended periods.  3\\. **Support for Sustainable Practices** : Purchasing eco-friendly stationery supports companies and industries that prioritize environmental responsibility, promoting a market shift towards sustainability.  4\\. **Health Benefits:** Sustainable stationery often avoids the use of toxic chemicals found in some plastic products, reducing potential health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances.  Comparative Analysis  To better understand the distinctions between the stationery, let’s examine specific product categories:  1\\. **Pens** :  • **Plastic Pens:** Typically made from non-recyclable plastics, these pens contribute significantly to waste. Their production involves substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions.  • Sustainable Pens: Options include pens made from recycled materials, biodegradable plastics, or renewable resources like bamboo. Some innovative designs feature refillable ink cartridges, reducing the need for disposable pens.  2\\. **Notebooks** :  • Conventional Notebooks: Often produced using virgin paper and components, leading to deforestation and increased plastic waste.  • Eco-Friendly Notebooks: Made from 100% recycled paper or alternative fibers, these notebooks reduce the demand for virgin paper. Some brands use eco- friendly inks and avoid plastic in bindings and covers.  3\\. **Folders and Binders** :  • Folders: Manufactured from PVC or other plastics, they are durable but contribute to long-term environmental pollution due to their non-biodegradable nature.  • **Sustainable Alternatives** : Options include folders made from recycled cardboard, biodegradable materials, or sustainably sourced wood products, offering similar functionality with reduced environmental impact.  * * *  **Waste Statistics and Environmental Concerns**  The environmental impact of stationery is underscored by alarming waste statistics:  • **Global Plastic Production:** Since the 1950s, the production has increased exponentially, with over 400 million metric tonnes produced annually. A significant portion of this includes single-use and disposable items, such as stationery.  • **Recycling Rates:** Despite efforts to promote recycling, only about 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. The vast majority ends up in landfills, incinerated, or polluting the environment.  • **Office Waste:** In Australia, over 90% of office plastic waste ends up in landfills or the environment, with only a small fraction being recycled or properly disposed of. This not only strains waste management systems but also poses severe risks to ecosystems and human health.  **The Case for Transitioning to Sustainable Stationery**  Given the environmental challenges posed by stationery, transitioning to sustainable alternatives offers a viable solution:  1\\. **Environmental Preservation** : Choosing sustainable stationery reduces pollution, conserves resources, and supports ecosystem health.  2\\. **Economic Benefits** : While some eco-friendly products may have a higher upfront cost, they often offer long-term savings through durability and the potential for reuse or refilling.  3\\. **Corporate Responsibility** : Businesses adopting sustainable stationery demonstrate corporate social responsibi …\n",

      "Excerpt: Zero Waste Pens - Most Eco-Friendly Writing Utensils - Zero Waste Memoirs Skip to content  Sustainable living made easy  Menu  Menu    * AT HOME   * AWAY   * CULTURE   * SHOPPING   * About     * Privacy Policy     * Affiliate Disclosure     * Contact  # Zero Waste Pens - Most Eco-Friendly Writing Utensils  March 18, 2025 by wendyj  How many pens do you have at home? 10? 20? 50? Multiply this by billions of people, and that’s a lot of pens being used, and a lot of pens destined for the trash. Back in 2005, BIC – a single brand – celebrated its 100 billionth sale. Just imagine where we are now.  Plastic straws and bags have been under fire for being unnecessarily wasteful, but almost no one addresses this everyday writing utensil and the options available for eco-friendly and zero waste pens.  This article may contain compensated/affiliate links. See our full disclosure **here**.  * * *      ## **Why are pens bad for the environment?**  First and foremost, the pen’s plastic bodies are not usually recycled. More often than not, they’re simply discarded in the trash where they’ll take hundreds of years to decompose.  And considering how often people lose them, many probably don’t even make it to the landfill.  The environmental impact doesn’t end there though. Consider the ink left in pens and how this contaminates soil and water. Add in the environmental cost of raw materials and production, and you’ll soon realise pens have a hefty environmental footprint.  ## **Can you recycle pens?**  Pen recycling isn’t as easy as putting pens in your curbside bin, but it does exist. Bic and TerraCycle have created a national recycling programme for writing instruments that was created to help tackle the pen waste problem.  You can request a label online and send your used pens, markers, highlighters, and even paint sets and flexible packing to TerraCycle to be recycled.      With 5,500 participating locations in the US, there may even be a drop-off point at your local OfficeMax, Staples, public library, or school. And if there’s not, you could be the person to start one.  Alternatively, you can upcycle old pens. The bodies without the ink cartridges make great garden stakes, drink stirrers, or cat toys. If you’re feeling crafty, you can string them together into a placemat or cut them apart to make beads.  Some people like “the Pen Guy” have even made amazing works of art out of many people’s old pens.  * * *  ## Most **Eco Friendly Pens**  With the exception of quill pens (which are not at all practical), there’s no such thing as _completely_ zero waste pens. There are some eco-friendly pens, however, and as consumers become more aware of plastic waste, the market for plastic-free pens is expanding.  Let’s look at some of the best options for zero waste pens. You can read more about why these pens have been chosen below.  | Name | Type | Refillable | Price   ---|---|---|---|---      | LAMY 2000 | Fountain | Yes | **Check Here**      | Diplomat Traveller | Fountain | Yes | **Check Here**      | Pilot Metropolitan | Fountain | Yes | **Check Here**         | Eco Pen Club | Ballpoint | No | **Check Here**      | Conscience Concepts | Ballpoint | No | **Check Here**      | Simply Genius | Ballpoint | No | **Check Here**      | Pilot B2B | Ballpoint | Yes | **Check Here**      | Onyx & Green | Ballpoint | No | **Check Here**      | BIC Ecolutions | Ballpoint | No | **Check Here**      | Seltzer Seven Year Pen | Ballpoint | Yes | **Check Here**      | Sprout Plantable Pencils | Pencil | No | **Check Here**         | Three Leaf Recycled Paper Pencils | Pencil | No | **Check Here**      ### FOUNTAIN PENS  Often thought of as archaic and difficult, fountain pens are actually quite easy to use and many people even find them much more enjoyable to write with.  Essentially ink reservoirs with a metal nibs at the end, they can be used over and over and refilled with ink when they run out. Because they are made of metal or stainless steel, they are very durable and can last from generation to generation.      Nibs can be changed out, giving you the ability to write finer or broader lines all with the same writing instrument. And there are also plenty of ink colors to choose from if you don’t like the typical black or blue – making fountain pens a versatile choice.  Modern fountain pens also have an easy filling system allowing you to draw ink up into the pen by submerging the nib and turning the barrel.  Unfortunately, the environmental cost of sourcing the metals used in fountain pens doesn’t make them 100% eco-friendly. But the good news is that if you buy a quality pen, it should last you a lifetime, meaning they’re as close as you’re going to get to a truly zero waste pen.  #### **Best eco-friendly fountain pens** & Ink Refills  **LAMY 2000 FOUNTAIN PEN**      For the ultimate writing experience, you can’t beat this elegant fountain pen from German brand Lamy.  Made from Black fiberglass and stainless steel, this pen is made to last. And the 14K gold, platinum coated nib writes like a dream.  This premium fountain pen is refillable with an ink bottle, making it the most environmentally friendly pen option.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **DIPLOMAT TRAVELLER FOUNTAIN PEN**      Manufactured in Germany using traditional methods, Diplomat Fountain Pens have been leading the way for almost 100 years.  The Diplomat Traveller Fountain Pen is a crowd favorite as it writes smoothly without any skipping.  While this eco-friendly pen is sold with a disposable cartridge, it can be refilled from an inkwell by buying an inexpensive converter.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **PILOT METROPOLITAN FOUNTAIN PEN**      For those on a budget, the Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen is your best bet at finding an affordable eco-friendly pen.  Known as being among the best fountain pens for beginners, the Metropolitan Pen is easy to use, writes exceptionally well, and will last you many years.  Like the Diplomat option above, you’ll need a converter to make it a truly zero waste pen.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  #### Best Refillable Ink Options for Fountain Pens    * **Iroshizuku Bottled Fountain Pen Ink by PILOT**   * **J Herbin Fountain Pen Ink**   * **Waterman Bottled Ink**  * * *  ### BIODEGRADABLE PENS  Growing concern about plastic waste has led to more companies producing biodegradable pens. Now it’s possible to find pens made from recycled paper, biodegradable cornstarch, and FSC-certified wood.  These pens are usually refillable, but their ink cartridges have to be replaced, resulting in some waste contributing to the cycle. Their material also makes them less durable than fountain pens, so they won’t last for life, and you’ll need to factor in production and shipping costs.  If you’re not ready to make the switch to a fountain pen, however, these non plastic pens are a great option. Make sure you also search for ones that have plant-based or soy-based inks, which will be less contaminating to the earth should they end up in landfill.  #### Best Biodegradable Pens  **ECO PEN CLUB BALL POINT PENS**         Using 85% less plastic than traditional pens, these eco-friendly alternatives from the Eco Pen Club are an earth-friendly choice.  Made using recycled craft paper and non-toxic soy based ink, the body can be composted, and the cartridge recycled after use.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **CONSCIENCE CONCEPTS CORK& WHEAT PENS**      A unique combination of cork and wheat straw has been used to create these almost zero waste pens.  Cork is one of the most sustainable materials available (if harvested correctly), and when combined with the by-product of wheat straw – it’s a winning combination.  These pens also come packaged in eco-friendly cardboard, further reducing their environmental impact.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **SIMPLY GENIUS ECO-FRIENDLY PENS**      While there’s no such thing (that we’ve found) as a 100% briodegradable pen, these eco-friendly pens from Simply Genius do get close.  Made from biodegradable paper and recyclable plastic, they’re a good choice if you still need to buy pens in bulk. But do note that they’re shipped in plastic and it’s unclear if the paper used in construction is recycled.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  ### RECYCLED PLASTIC PENS  Why not recycle other plastic into pens? Well, that’s exactly what many companies have done. Even the major players like Bic and Pilot now offer pens made from up to 86% post-consumer waste.  While this doesn’t solve the problem of what to do with them once these recycled pens break or run out, it’s still better than buying completely new plastic pens.  With some big name companies on board, these also tend to be cheaper and easier to find than biodegradable pens.  #### Best Recycled Plastic pens  **PILOT B2B REFILLABLE PENS**      Not only are these nifty ballpoint pens made from recycled water bottles, they’re also refillable so there’s no need to replace them every time they run out of ink.  PILOT have been making pens for decades, so they know what they’re doing & these smooth ballpoint pens don’t disappoint on writing quality.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **ONYX AND GREEN RECYCLED PET PENS**      Made from recycled PET plastics and packaged in recycled cardboard, these ballpoint pens from Onyx and Green make a good alternative to traditional pens.  Unfortunately, they’re not refillable, but they are recyclable, making them a eco-friendly alternative.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  **BIC ECOLUTIONS PENS**      The pen giants, BIC have come up with their own solution to the plastic pen problem.  This eco-friendly pen option is made from 74% recycled plastic, which means it’s taking waste out of the system while reducing the production of new plastic.  But while it’s a step up from their traditional plastic pens, it’s not refillable, so isn’t our preferred zero waste pen.  **Buy from Amazon here**  * * *  ### LONG-LASTING PENS  Another idea that’s gaini …\n",

The first step in their production process is collecting and sorting these recyclable materials, which are then cleaned and broken down into small particles. The material is often melted into a resin that can be moulded for plastic-based pens. These plastic pellets are reshaped into pen components, such as barrels, caps, and grips. Depending on the pen's design and functionality, manufacturers may also incorporate other recycled materials, such as paper, wood, or even metals. Quality control ensures that the recycled materials meet durability and safety standards without compromising writing performance.  Once the raw materials are processed, the pen components are assembled. Ink reservoirs, which can also be made from recycled materials, are filled with ink and often formulated using eco-friendly ingredients. After assembly, the pens undergo testing to ensure they write smoothly and consistently. Many brands offer customisation options for **recycled pens**, allowing for branding or unique designs without losing the pen’s sustainability appeal. By using waste materials, the production of recycled pens not only reduces landfill waste but also significantly lowers energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to producing pens from virgin materials. This transformation from waste to writing tool represents a practical and impactful step toward a more sustainable future.

Have you ever wondered what goes into the price of your pen? The pen manufacturing cost can vary widely, depending on the materials used, the manufacturing process, and the brand. In this blog, we’ll explore how the pen-making cost varies based on several factors and break down the bottom price between luxury opinion and custom wholesale option.  ## Basic Materials in Pen Manufacturing Factory  The materials determine the cost of manufacturing a pen. Their quality, durability, and availability significantly impact the overall production expenses. Below, we break down the common materials used in pen manufacturing and estimate their cost per 500g.  ### Plastic (Polypropylene)  Polypropylene is a popular plastic used for the barrel and rear cap of many pens. It is lightweight, durable, and cost-effective, making it ideal for mass production. The approximate price of polypropylene is around $1 to $1.50 per 500g, depending on the grade and supplier.  ### Steel  Steel is typically used for the spring, ball, and ball socket in pens. It offers strength, durability, and smooth functionality, making it a staple in both standard and premium pens. The cost of steel can range from $5 to $7 per 500g, depending on the type and quality.  ### Stainless Steel or Iron  Stainless steel or iron is used for the pen clip, providing both durability and an attractive finish. Stainless steel is more expensive than iron, with a price range of $6 to $12 per 500g, while iron may cost around $3 to $5 per 500g.  ### Ink  Ink, typically a viscous oil-based formula, is one of the most crucial components of pen manufacturing. The price of ink varies depending on the quality and formulation. On average, ink costs between $10 and $15 per 500g for standard oil-based formulas, though more specialized inks may cost more.  ### Tungsten Carbide  Tungsten carbide is used for the ballpoint tip due to its hardness and durability, ensuring smooth and long-lasting writing. This high-quality material is more expensive, with an approximate price of $40 to $50 per 500g, making it one of the more costly components in pen production.  ## Ball Pen Making Raw Material Price [Cost Breakdown]  Now, to better analyze the pen making raw material price, we are going to break down the price based on a typical 15g metal ballpoint pen, which costs approximately $0.59. Let's explore the cost breakdown for each essential part.  ### Barrel    * **Weight per Unit:** 6g   * **Material:** Metal (Aluminum or Steel)   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.18  The barrel is one of the heaviest components of a ballpoint pen. It typically weighs around 6g and is made from materials such as metal, commonly aluminum or steel. The material cost for a barrel is approximately $0.18 per unit. With 500g of raw material, you can produce roughly 83 barrels.  ### Rear Cap    * **Weight per Unit:** 2g   * **Material:** Plastic (Polypropylene)   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.05  The rear cap, usually made of plastic like polypropylene, is a lighter part of the pen. It weighs about 2g and costs around $0.05 per unit. If you have 500g of polypropylene, you could produce approximately 250 rear caps.  ### Spring    * **Weight per Unit:** 0.5g   * **Material:** Steel   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.02  The spring is a small yet important component in the pen’s retracting mechanism. It weighs only 0.5g and is made from steel, with a unit cost of about $0.02. Using 500g of steel, you could produce around 1000 springs.  ### Mine Assembly    * **Weight per Unit:** 3g   * **Material:** Plastic, Ink, and Metal   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.20  The mine assembly holds the ink and the ballpoint mechanism, making it a crucial part of the pen. It typically weighs around 3g and is made of plastic, ink, and metal components, costing about $0.20 per unit. With 500g of raw material (a mix of plastic, ink, and metal), you can produce approximately 166 mine assemblies.  ### Ball    * **Weight per Unit:** 0.1g   * **Material:** Tungsten Carbide   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.03  The ball, often made from tungsten carbide, is essential for the smooth writing experience. It weighs about 0.1g and costs around $0.03 per ball. If you have 500g of tungsten carbide, you could produce approximately 5000 balls.  ### Ball Socket    * **Weight per Unit:** 0.3g   * **Material:** Stainless Steel   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.04  The ball socket is a small part that holds the ballpoint in place, ensuring it writes smoothly. It is typically made from stainless steel and weighs about 0.3g. The cost per unit for a ball socket is around $0.04. Using 500g of stainless steel, you can produce around 1666 ball sockets.  ### Ink    * **Weight per Unit:** 1g   * **Material:** Oil-based Ink   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.03  Ink is the lifeblood of the pen, filling the ink reservoir and allowing for smooth writing. It typically weighs around 1g per unit, and its cost is approximately $0.03 per unit. With 500g of ink, you can fill ink reservoirs for about 500 pens.  ### Reservoir    * **Weight per Unit:** 1.1g   * **Material:** Plastic   * **Cost per Unit:** $0.05  The reservoir holds the ink inside the pen, ensuring a consistent flow. It typically weighs about 1.1g and is made of plastic. Each reservoir costs around $0.05. Since each reservoir weighs 1.1 g, 500g of plastic can produce approximately 454 reservoirs.  ## Chart Summary: Components from 500g Raw Material  **Component**| **Weight per Unit (g)**| **Cost per Unit ($)**| **Number of Units from 500g**   ---|---|---|---   **Barrel**|  6g| $0.18| 83   **Rear Cap**|  2g| $0.05| 250   **Spring (Steel)**|  0.5g| $0.02| 1000   **Mine Assembly**|  3g| $0.20| 166   **Ball (Tungsten)**|  0.1g| $0.03| 5000   **Ball Socket**|  0.3g| $0.04| 1666   **Ink**|  1g| $0.03| 500   **Reservoir**|  1.1g| $0.05| 454      ## The Total Cost Comparison: High-End vs. Bulk Production  Want more cheaper?

While it may seem like a small and insignificant item, the process of manufacturing a pen involves various materials, machinery, and labor costs. In this article, we will explore the cost breakdown of making a pen, provide two different versions of the manufacturing process, discuss interesting trends in the pen industry, and address common concerns related to pen production.  Cost Breakdown of Making a Pen:  To understand the cost of making a pen, we need to consider all the components involved in its production. These components include materials, labor, machinery, packaging, and overhead costs. Let's break down each of these costs to get a better understanding of how much it really costs to make a pen.  1\\. Materials: The materials used to make a pen include the pen body (usually made of plastic or metal), the ink cartridge, and any additional embellishments such as clips or grips. The cost of these materials can vary depending on the quality and quantity purchased. On average, the materials for a single pen can cost anywhere from $0.50 to $2.00.  2\\. Labor: The labor costs involved in making a pen include the wages of the workers involved in the manufacturing process. This includes machine operators, assemblers, quality control inspectors, and packaging personnel. The labor costs can vary depending on the location of the manufacturing facility and the skill level of the workers. On average, the labor costs for making a pen can range from $0.50 to $1.50 per pen.  3\\. Machinery: The machinery used in the manufacturing process of pens includes injection molding machines, assembly lines, and packaging equipment. The cost of machinery can be significant, especially for large-scale pen manufacturers. The depreciation and maintenance costs of the machinery are also factored into the overall cost of making a pen.  4\\. Packaging: Packaging plays an important role in the presentation and protection of pens. The cost of packaging materials such as boxes, blister packs, and labels should be included in the total cost of making a pen. The packaging costs can range from $0.10 to $0.50 per pen.  5\\. Overhead Costs: Overhead costs include expenses such as rent, utilities, insurance, and administrative costs that are not directly tied to the production of pens. These costs are spread out across all units produced and are factored into the selling price of the pens.  Taking all these costs into consideration, the total cost of making a pen can range from $2.00 to $6.00 per unit. This cost can vary depending on the scale of production, the complexity of the design, and the quality of materials used.  Two Versions of the Pen Manufacturing Process:  There are two main processes involved in making pens: injection molding and assembly.  Injection Molding Process:  1\\. The first step in the injection molding process is to create a mold of the pen body design. This mold is made of steel and is precision-machined to the exact specifications of the pen.  2\\. Plastic pellets are then heated to a molten state and injected into the mold under high pressure. The plastic cools and solidifies, taking on the shape of the mold.  3\\. Once the pen body is removed from the mold, it undergoes additional processes such as trimming, polishing, and assembly of components like the ink cartridge and clip.  4\\. Quality control checks are performed to ensure that each pen meets the desired specifications.  5\\. The pens are then packaged and prepared for distribution to retailers.  Assembly Process:  1\\. In the assembly process, the individual components of the pen such as the pen body, ink cartridge, clip, and grip are assembled by hand or by automated machinery.  2\\. The assembled pens undergo quality control checks to ensure that all components are correctly fitted and functioning properly.  3\\. The pens are then packaged and labeled before being shipped to retailers for sale.  Interesting Trends in the Pen Industry:  1\\. Sustainable Materials: With the increasing focus on environmental sustainability, many pen manufacturers are turning to eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastics, bamboo, and biodegradable inks. This trend reflects the growing consumer demand for products that are both functional and environmentally conscious.  2\\. Customization Options: Personalization is a growing trend in the pen industry, with many manufacturers offering custom engraving, color choices, and unique designs. This trend caters to consumers looking for pens that reflect their individual style and preferences.  3\\. Digital Integration: Some pens are now equipped with digital features such as stylus tips for touchscreens, USB drives, and Bluetooth connectivity. This trend combines the traditional writing experience with modern technology, appealing to tech-savvy consumers.  4\\. Luxury Market: Luxury pens made from high-quality materials such as gold, silver, and precious gemstones continue to be popular among collectors and enthusiasts. These pens are often limited edition and come with hefty price tags, catering to a niche market of luxury pen connoisseurs.  Common Concerns and Answers Related to Pen Production:  1\\. Are pens made in the USA more expensive than those made overseas?  - The cost of making pens in the USA can be higher due to labor and overhead costs. However, some consumers are willing to pay a premium for products made domestically to support local businesses and ensure quality control.  2\\. Are there any health risks associated with using plastic pens?  - Plastic pens are generally safe to use, but some concerns have been raised about the potential presence of harmful chemicals such as BPA in plastic materials. To address this issue, many pen manufacturers now offer BPA-free and non-toxic pens.  3\\. How can I dispose of used pens responsibly?  - To reduce waste and environmental impact, it is recommended to recycle used pens whenever possible. Some pen manufacturers have implemented recycling programs to collect and repurpose old pens into new products.  4\\. Can I refill ink cartridges in disposable pens?  - Some disposable pens are designed to be refillable, allowing users to extend the lifespan of the pen and reduce waste. Refillable ink cartridges are available for purchase separately, making it easy to refill the pen with your preferred ink color.  5\\. Are gel pens more expensive to produce than ballpoint pens?  - Gel pens typically require a more complex manufacturing process and use specialized inks, which can contribute to higher production costs. As a result, gel pens are often priced higher than traditional ballpoint pens.  6\\. Do expensive pens write better than inexpensive ones?  - The quality of a pen's writing performance is not always determined by its price tag. Factors such as ink flow, comfort grip, and tip size can all contribute to the overall writing experience regardless of the pen's cost.  7\\. Are there any regulations governing the production of pens?  - Pen manufacturers are subject to various regulations regarding product safety, labeling, and environmental impact. Compliance with these regulations ensures that pens meet quality standards and are safe for consumer use.  8\\. Can I customize my own pens for promotional purposes?  - Many pen manufacturers offer custom printing and engraving services for businesses looking to create branded promotional pens. This allows companies to customize pens with their logo or message for marketing purposes.  9\\. Are there any innovations in pen design that improve ergonomics?  - Some pens are designed with ergonomic features such as cushioned grips, lightweight materials, and adjustable angles to reduce hand fatigue and improve writing comfort.  10\\.

March 3, 2022December 25, 2018 by Christoph Roser  I was on a quest, a quest to find the cheapest ballpoint pen possible. And what I found was amazing. Modern manufacturing has achieved stunning productivity, where even a complex product like a ballpoint pen can be produced at costs that were unbelievable only a few decades ago. While everybody can make a pen, the goal in manufacturing is always to make it cheaper! For the same functionality, the customer will almost always go for the cheaper products. Let me show you the results of my quest.  ## The Product  The product I was after is simple. A ballpoint pen with a retractable point. You all used it at one point or another. With cheap pens you probably don't bother with replacing the ink reservoir, but simply throw out the pen when it is empty, unless of course you lost the pen beforehand. Pens nowadays are so cheap, it is just not worth fixing them. I wanted to see how cheap I could get. The price I was looking at was for bulk purchase (think 100,000 pens or so) and would not include shipping and value added taxes.  But please be reminded that a pen is a by no means simple product. It has multiple moving parts, including a precision ball in a socket that gave the pen its name. This ball is often made out of tungsten carbide for reduced wear, although I could not analyze the material of my quest pens.  There is also a mechanism for the retracting and extending of the tip and the ink reservoir. Overall, it is a complex product with quite a few engineering specifications and tolerances.  ## The Pens  ### Pen 1: Manors  The first cheap pen I found – surprisingly enough – in Germany. For a measly EUR 0.0637 (around USD 0.0723) I get a working pen (for quantities of 70,000 and up). And – second surprise – it is actually a pretty decent pen. It writes well, the retracting mechanism feels good, it does not look ugly, and it even has a small rubber grip to make it easier to hold. When I say it writes well, I mean of course for a low-cost pen. Naturally, you can find high-end pens that promise eternal bliss while writing, but if you just want to get a line on the paper, this is good enough. Altogether this pen is made of eleven components. Since I bought only around fifteen pens, I had to pay around €5 in shipping for €0.95 worth of pens  ### Pen 2: Wessex  On the same site I found an even cheaper pen for only EUR 0.0606 (USD 0.0688) (for quantities of 75,000 and up). Since it did not have a nice rubber grip, it felt a bit cheaper, and to me it also looked a bit cheaper, even though the barrel had a metallic finish (still plastic though) and the tip had a fancy over-mold, where the blue part seems to have been directly molded on top of the gray part. This makes the mold a bit more expensive. Since each pen was in a clear plastic bag, the product still had eleven parts, although I could not disassemble the clip without breaking it.  ### Pen 3: No Name  Next I set my sights on the source of probably most pens in the world: China! And a good site to browse Chinese products is Alibaba. Here I found my next quest item from the Yiwu JC Import & Export Co., Ltd., a pen for a whopping USD 0.0450 (EUR 0.0396) (price asked for a quantity of 115,000). This one also looked nice and had a rubber grip. The design was also not bad. As part of the assembly, the end cap was screwed onto the thrust tube, hence the mold for both the end caps and the thrust tube needed a thread. The clip was also glued on. With altogether thirteen parts (including glue), it had the highest number of parts of the pens I looked at in more detail.  ### Pen 4: No Name  The same source at Alibaba also had an even cheaper pen for USD 0.035 (EUR 0.0308)(price asked for a quantity of 115,000). But now it starts to look and feel cheap. The pen still writes well, but they did save money on the clip mechanism. Rather than clipping with your thumb on the end cap, the end cap only pushes it in until the integrated clip arrests. A second press on the clip releases the reservoir again and it jumps back out. Hence, you have to press different locations for extending and retracting the tip. This pen has only seven different parts, the lowest of any of these four pens. However, I feel for USD 0.035 I cannot complain (although including shipping I paid $5 per sample pen). Shipping for 115,000 pens to Germany would have been $300 within forty to forty-five days.  ## How Do You Make a Pen for USD 0.035???  While pen #4 was definitely not the nicest pen, it was the cheapest, and hence I will look at this one in more detail. How on earth do you make a pen for USD 0.035 per pen?  Let's put this in perspective. Among the cheapest industrial wages paid in the world are around $1 per hour. You can get cheaper wages, but then the workers would not know how a light switch works, and would need to be trained before they can be used in industry – at which time they would commandeer higher wages. Even $1/hour is a bit extreme, especially since I do not include taxes and other overhead. But for the sake of the argument, let's stick with $1.  At $1/hour you will get for $0.035 a measly 2 minutes and six seconds. Hence, the entire labor in making this pen is less than 2.1 minutes! While this does not sound like much for assembling a pen, this 2.1 minutes also includes the mining, processing, shipping, and manufacturing of the pen.  You have to get the metals out of the ground as well as the oil for the plastic and ink. These have to be processed, formed, shaped, transformed, molded, and assembled. All of this needs (expensive) equipment. Do not forget the work of the engineers designing this pen as well as all the different machines, and they usually do not work for $1 per hour. Also do not forget logistics, energy, and a lot of other things.  The total human contribution is probably way less than 2 minutes. All the other contribution is through machines, automation, and other mechanical gadgets and gizmos. But if you buy a $0.035 pen, an infinitesimal small fraction of the money goes to the oil rig, the mine, and many other companies. The contribution is probably too small to measure, but it is making a profit for the industry!  Below is an overview of the components with their weight (measured), the material (educated guess), material cost (polypropylene $1/kg, steel $0.60/kg, ink $1/kg), and a very rough estimate of the production cost assuming production in very large quantities. I also added a generous half a cent for the final assembly. The total cost of the pen is probably USD 0.0051 for material and 0.015 for manufacturing for a total of USD 0.021 before profit and shipping (or less, I am not that familiar with Chinese prices). Still, amazingly cheap.  Component | Weight (g) | Material | Material Cost ($) | Production Cost ($)   ---|---|---|---|---   Barrel | 3.519 | Polypropylene | 0.0035 | 0.0033   Rear Cap | 0.826 | Polypropylene | 0.00083 | 0.0033   Spring | 0.175 | Steel | 0.00011 | (n/a)   Mine Assembly | 0.731 | (assembly) | n/a | 0.00047   Ball | 0.0003 | Steel | 0.00000018 | 0.00064   Ball Socket | 0.159 | Steel | 0.000095 | 0.0032   Ink | 0.098 | Pixie Dust? | 0.00098 | n/a   Reservoir | 0.474 | Polypropylene? | 0.00047 | 0.0034   **Total** | **5.2513** |  | **0.0051** | **0.015**      By the way, the hardest and most high-tech part to make is the ball and the ball socket. Until recently, China had to import all balls from Japan and Europe, since they did not have the technology to make them. The Yiwu JC Import & Export Co., Ltd. that made the two pens above also produces their own balls and ball sockets.  ## Can It Be Even Cheaper?  It can definitely be cheaper. If not now, then definitely in the future as manufacturing continues to advance and become even more productive. But probably even now you can find cheaper pens, although I believe not by much. I found even cheaper pens advertised, but these prices turned out to be doubtful.  The solution to our energy problems?  Amazon has plenty of pens for USD 0.01, but they come with $3 for shipping, and I guess the profit is in the shipping. The cheapest pen I saw advertised on Alibaba was less than half a cent at USD 0.004 (EUR 0.0035), but the supplier never returned my messages. Another pen advertised as USD 0.01 was not available at this price.  I guess the price was just to get my attention and not really an offer. Besides, at USD 0.004 for a 7g (0.24 ounce) pen, the pen has the same price by weight as heating oil. You may just as well heat your apartment by burning pens.  ## What About the Other End?  Of course, there is not really a firm upper limit on the price of ballpoint pens. At the time of writing, the most expensive ballpoint pen on Amazon.com was the Limited Edition Montegrappa Ernest Hemingway Traveller Ballpoint Pen, Gold 18k for USD 39,150.00 (and don't forget the 5.99 shipping).  For the same price you get 1,118,571 pens at 0.035 each. Is the writing of this Hemingway pen truly one million times better? I doubt it. But it does make a great conversation piece. Although for that price I still would rather buy two cars. Besides, with a weight of 99g (3.5 ounces), it is quite a hefty piece.  ## Summary  Please excuse me fo …\n",

It is clear and easy to mold.   * **Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)** : Preferred for electronic housings, automotive components, and toys because it is tough and impact-resistant.  **Impact on Costs**  The choice of raw material directly affects costs due to differences in pricing based on factors such as availability, market demand, and production processes:    * **Market Demand** : Materials like Polyethylene that are in high demand might have prices that change often because they are used so much.   * **Availability** : Some polymers are not easily available, which can make their prices go up.   * **Production Process** : Certain materials are more expensive to make because the process of turning them into plastic is complicated.  **Pricing Variations**  Changes in prices for raw materials can happen because of several reasons:    * **Global Oil Prices** : Since most plastics come from petrochemicals (chemicals made from oil), when the price of oil changes a lot, it also changes the cost of raw materials.   * **Supply Chain Disruptions** : Natural disasters, problems between countries, or issues with moving things around can all cause the supply chain to break. When this happens, prices can go up.   * **Economic Conditions** : When the economy is not stable or if there is too much inflation (prices going up), it can make the cost of raw materials increase.  **Strategies for Managing Raw Material Costs**  To manage raw material costs well:    1. **Buy in Bulk** :    * Purchasing raw materials in large amounts can lead to getting a discount because you are buying more.   * Making long-term contracts with suppliers can help keep prices steady and not change too much.    1. **Find Other Places to Get Materials From** :    * If you find other suppliers who can give you what you need, it lowers the risk of relying on just one source.   * Looking into using recycled or bio-based plastics as cheaper alternatives.    1. **Keep Track of What You Have in Stock** :    * Using systems that only bring in materials when they are needed helps reduce the cost of storing them and also makes sure there is not too much waste.   * Regularly checking how much inventory (stock) you have helps make sure it is being managed well.    1. **Be Good at Negotiating** :    * Building strong relationships with suppliers helps when talking about prices.   * Checking supplier contracts every now and then makes sure you are still getting a good deal compared to others.    1. **Use New Technology** :    * Investing in machines or tools that help use materials better reduces waste and makes everything cheaper.   * Trying out different ways of making things faster and easier means you get more plastic from the same amount of materials.    1. **Study the Market** :    * Keeping an eye on what is happening in the market helps you change how you buy things before it becomes a problem.   * Using tools that can guess what prices will do in the future helps with planning.  **Balancing Quality and Cost-effectiveness**  You should not forget about quality when trying to save money on materials:  > \"Both quality and cost are important. This makes sure that the final product > is good enough while also being affordable.\"    1. **Test New Materials** :    * Before using something different, make sure to check if it works well enough.    1. **Check Suppliers Regularly** :    * Making sure suppliers always give you good things means your products will be good too.    1. **Look at the Costs and Benefits** :    * Before changing anything, think about how much it will cost and what you will gain from doing it.    1. **Think About Sustainability** :    * Being careful about where materials come from is good for your brand and also saves money in the long run because you use less resources.  By knowing more about different materials, why their prices change, and ways to manage them well, you can make better choices that help your manufacturing costs without making things worse.  ### 2\\.

Whether you're buying school supplies for your children, office supplies for yourself, or contemplating to take a calligraphy class, you should know a few things about the impact of pens, pencils, erasers and more on the environment. Usually, my favourite writing utensil happens to be whichever pen has crossed my path that week. It might be from a hotel or business – in other words, I don't consciously choose it.  But what if we did actively choose our writing utensils, helping reduce plastic waste and the toxic ingredients used in conventional writing items?      Let’s find out what eco-friendly writing tools are available to minimise waste produced by disposable utensils!  ## The Problem with “Traditional” Plastic Pens  Plastic pens are one of the most commonly used writing tools in the world. Even with computers replacing many handwritten documents, pens are, of course, still used daily to sign physical papers or take notes every day. If you’re like me, you’ve used these pens until the ink runs out – always, maddeningly, in the middle of a very important word – and then toss them in the recycling. So what’s the issue? The issue is that without having their metal components removed, plastic pens actually aren’t recyclable. Shocking, I know.  This means that the pens you use and dispose of are actually ending up in landfills. In the United States alone, Americans throw away an estimated 1.6 billion pens each year. That’s a lot of plastic that could be either be recycled or just not manufactured in the first place. So what can you do?  ## 10 Sustainable Pens and Pencils to Consider  Whether you’re a pen or pencil lover, you can reduce waste (and treat yourself) by consciously choosing one of the following sustainable pens or pencils, all of which are better for the environment than cheap plastic pens.  #### 1\\. Recycled Paper Pens  The barrel of these pens are made from 100% recycled paper, with a wooden clip and a 98% recycled plastic accent. Or you can choose from these recycled cardboard pens, with this particular brand working with 80% recycled materials.      Or, you also have the option of choosing pencils made from recycled paper, if you’re more of a pencil person (I see you, pencil people!).      If you are in the UK, check out the Green Stationery Company to complete your writing tools with pencil sharpeners and erasers.  #### 2\\. Biodegradable Corn Pens  These pens are made out of corn starch plastic, although there are concerns about the throwaway nature of these pens. They’re not much different from typical disposable pens, in that they are simply discarded once the ink is gone. However, biodegradable corn starch can decompose in about a year, and could make it easy to transition from traditional plastic pens to more eco- friendly ones, giving landfills a break.  #### 3\\. Recycled Newspaper Pencils  Custom printed pencils made from rolled-up recycled newspapers via treesmart One sheet of recycled newspaper makes three of these pencils, giving purpose to old newspapers and preventing the use of new wood!  #### 4\\. Recycled Water Bottle Pens  There are many choices of pens made out of recycled water bottles, including models by big-name manufacturers Pilot and Pentel. However, although recycled, these pens are still plastic; at the end of their life, you’ll need to send them to a designated recycling facility or else they’ll end up in landfill.  #### 5\\. Inkless Pens  The Inkless Pen, “reviving the age-old technique of writing with metal” Itself made of metal, this pen uses metal instead of ink. Writing in grey, the tip never needs to be sharpened, and will never run out; a permanent replacement for throwaway plastic pens!  #### 6\\. Sprout Eco-Friendly Wood Pencils  Sprout wooden pencils are pretty cool. They were born to be reincarnated: each contains the seeds of a flower or plant, so when you’ve used it down to the nub, plant it in soil and watch a cute little plant sprout! They also have a range of colored pencils for coloring book enthusiasts. The capsule at the end of the pencil which contains the seeds is biodegradable, and the pencil itself is made from sustainable Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified cedar wood. Choose from ten non-genetically-modified (non-GMO) seeds, and nine different coloured, 100% natural clay or graphite pigment cores.  #### 7\\. Refillable Bamboo Pen  This ballpoint pen is made from sustainable bamboo wood, and comes with a refillable ink cartridge. Although cartridges do generate waste, they are more eco-friendly than plastic pens which tend to run out at a faster pace – keep reading for even more eco-friendly, cartridge-free options!  #### 8\\. Fabula Biodegradable Pencil  I have to admit, anything with the word “tea” catches my eye. Where are my fellow tea lovers?! Whether you’re a tea, coffee, or flower fan, you’re going to love these biodegradable pencils from Fabula. Made from - you guessed it - recycled tea, coffee, and flowers, these pencils are wood-free and include a capsule on the end, similar to the Sprout pencil, containing seeds which give the pencil an extra lease of life. Plus, they look really cool!  #### 9\\. Recycled Car, Fridge, and CD Case Pencils  These pencils from Remarkable are pretty cool. They give plastics generated from disposed cars, fridges, and CDs new life in the form of a pencil.  Just be sure to properly recycle to prevent these plastics ultimately ending up in the environment!  #### 10\\. Go Old School with a Fountain Pen  By going old school with a traditional fountain pen, you can purchase a bottle of ink and refill as necessary. You can even choose recyclable glass ink bottles, so you’ll never run out of ink, and have a zero-waste option for your writing (and even drawing!). You can buy used fountain pens online and eco- friendly ink refills are available. As fountain pen ink is generally composed mainly of water, it’s easy to go natural, such as with walnut ink, or you can even make your own with natural ingredients!  ## Other Things to Consider  You thought that was all, didn’t you? See anything you like? Well, let’s review a few final points before we make the journey to our next writing tools.  #### So what’s up with the ink cartridges?  Above, we’ve discussed ink pens that require cartridges. Although each cartridge will provide a pen with new life, it’s possible to run through them rather quickly, defeating the intention of reduced plastic usage. Although an improvement on traditional plastic pens, if you want to eliminate the waste, it may be better to go with a fountain pen, inkless pen, or the pencils we’ve reviewed! Fountain pen. Photo by Aaron Burden on Unsplash  ####  What about mechanical pencils?  Though mechanical pencils can be refilled, the plastic they’re made from is toxic. However, if you’re able to not lose your mechanical pencil for as long as you exist, it could be a worthwhile investment.  #### Where can I recycle my pens?  Bic, which sells millions of pens every year, is looking to help reduce the plastic waste generated by disposable pens and wants to help you recycle your pen waste. Check out their recycling program here. (Although the company is purported to test their products on animals, so I don’t generally support them.) With any of these pens, it’s essential to recycle them properly when they reach the end of their life. Although it might be okay to throw a biodegradable corn pen away, you still need to remove the metal tip. By sending your pens to a recycling program, they can be disposed of correctly.  #### Isn’t using a computer more sustainable?  Perhaps, although computer components and manufacture includes much plastic, toxic substances, heavy metals, and ‘conflict minerals’, as well as the carbon footprint of their usage. Also, because of built-in obsolescence, much technology doesn’t last very long, with many users upgrading to new devices when older models become software-incompatible. This upgrading can leave devices unused, or even thrown away, polluting the environment if not disposed of properly!  ## Did You Find Your Next Love?  I know I’ll probably use up all the disposable pens lying around the house before I invest in a more sustainable option (might as well use them and then dispose of them properly!). Encourage people and companies you know to consider how they’re making their pens and to think about where they end up. As consumers, there’s power in what we purchase, and companies are usually willing to listen to our preferences! _Featured photo by_ _Kelli Tungay_ _on_ _Unsplash_  ### AuthorJenn Ryan  When Jenn isn't writing about animal rights, you can find her sipping green tea out of a pink unicorn mug and running down the road wearing biodegradable glitter.  ## Sign up to our newsletter  Subscribe for fortnightly guides to ethical living and news on the best new ethical brands 🙌 Sign Up  ##  Related PostsView more  Inspiration, Sustainability  ### Are Vinyl Records Sustainable?

      "Excerpt: Skip to content    * Sample Page  Toggle Menu  # How Much Does it Cost to Make a Fountain Pen: Quick Breakdown  ByJoshua Bartlett PublishedJuly 12, 2023July 24, 2023 UpdatedJuly 24, 2023 Fountain pens have long been admired for their elegance and smooth writing experience. However, not all fountain pens come with the same price tag, and understanding the costs involved in producing one can shed some light on the varying prices in the market. In this article, we will explore the different factors that contribute to the cost of making a fountain pen. To create a fountain pen, several components must be crafted and assembled precisely. These include the nib, which can be made from various materials like stainless steel or gold; the feed, which regulates ink flow; and the barrel and cap that house the inner workings. Each of these elements can impact the final cost of production, depending on factors like material quality, design complexity, and manufacturing processes. In the following sections, we'll discuss the costs associated with different fountain pen components, as well as explore how these factors can influence the overall price of the pen. Through this information, we hope to offer insights into why you may see such significant price variations when browsing for a new fountain pen. So, let's dive in and learn more about the intriguing world of fountain pen production!  ## Fountain Pen Components  When discussing the cost of making a fountain pen, it's important to consider the different components that make up the pen itself. In this section, we will go over the main parts of a fountain pen, namely the nib, barrel, cap, feed, and ink reservoir.  ### Nib  The nib is the part of the fountain pen that touches the paper and transfers the ink. Nibs can be made from various materials, including steel, gold, and stainless steel. Both gold nibs and steel nibs come in different designs and sizes, affecting the overall cost of the pen. Typically, gold nibs are more expensive due to their material and unique writing properties.  ### Barrel  The barrel is the main body of the fountain pen that holds the ink reservoir. Barrels can be made from a variety of materials, such as wood, acrylic, or precious metals like silver or gold. The choice of material can significantly impact the price of the pen, with precious metals and exotic woods driving up costs.  ### Cap  The cap is an essential component of the fountain pen that protects the nib when not in use. It can be designed from materials similar to the barrel, including metals, wood, or acrylic. A fancy cap may add to the overall appearance and cost of the pen.  ### Feed  The feed is responsible for transferring ink from the reservoir to the nib. It can be made from plastic or ebonite, a hard rubber material. Ebonite feeds are considered more desirable for their ink flow properties, but they also come with a higher price tag compared to plastic feeds.  ### Ink Reservoir  The ink reservoir holds the ink inside the pen. Common types of ink reservoirs include cartridges and converters. Cartridges are usually less expensive, disposable ink containers, while converters allow the user to refill the pen from a bottle of ink, adding some cost to the pen's production. In summary, each component of the fountain pen plays a role in determining the overall cost of manufacturing the pen. Factors such as design, materials, and construction contribute to the range of prices one can expect. With this understanding of fountain pen components, we can now move on to other aspects of fountain pen manufacturing costs.  ## Materials and Quality  ### Metals  Fountain pens can be made from a variety of metals, each contributing to the overall quality and cost of the pen. Some common metals used in their construction include **brass, aluminum, and stainless steel**. These materials provide a sturdy and durable pen structure and often contribute to the pen's weight and balance. Additionally, precious metals like **gold, silver, platinum, and titanium** are used in high-end pens, making them more luxurious, expensive, and sought after.  ### Woods and Plastics  Wood and plastic materials are also frequently used to craft the barrels and caps of fountain pens. Woods can range from budget-friendly options like **maple and oak** to more expensive and exotic varieties such as **ebony, rosewood, and burl**. These materials can make pens feel warmer and more comfortable to handle. On the other hand, plastics, including **resin and acrylic** , are lightweight and durable, making them a popular choice for pen manufacturers. High-quality plastics also offer an array of colors and patterns, enhancing the pen's visual appeal.  ### Nib Materials  The nib, being the part of the pen that directly interacts with the paper, has a significant impact on writing performance and overall quality. Nib materials can drastically affect the cost of a fountain pen. Common materials include **stainless steel, gold, and titanium**. Stainless steel is an affordable and durable option, providing pleasant writing experiences for many users. Gold nibs, available in various karats (e.g., 14k, 18k), offer a softer, smoother writing experience due to their flexibility and natural resistance to corrosion. However, they are more expensive. Titanium nibs are also sought after for their unique combination of flexibility, durability, and affordability compared to gold. To give you an idea of how these materials can affect the cost of making a fountain pen, we've compiled a table with some examples: | Material | Category | Cost Impact   ---|---|---   Brass | Metal | Budget to Moderate   Silver | Precious Metal | Moderate to High   Platinum | Precious Metal | High   Maple | Wood | Budget   Rosewood | Wood | Moderate to High   Acrylic | Plastic | Budget to Moderate   Stainless Steel | Nib | Budget   Gold (14k, 18k) | Nib | Moderate to High   Titanium | Nib | Moderate      The choice of materials plays a significant role in determining the cost and overall quality of a fountain pen. From the pen's barrel to the nib, different metals, woods, plastics, and precious metals offer various benefits and appeal to users with differing preferences. In the following section, we'll explore how these factors combine to create fountain pens with a broad range of price points.  ## Manufacturing Process  ### Handmade vs. Mass-Produced  In the world of fountain pens, there are two primary production methods: handmade and mass-produced. Handmade fountain pens exemplify art, design, and craftsmanship, often involving intricate engraving and detailing. These pens typically come at a higher price due to the time, skill, and specialized tools required for creation. On the other end of the spectrum, mass-produced pens are made using standard equipment and manufacturing techniques, allowing for lower costs and higher volume production.  ### Tools, Equipment, and Techniques  **Handmade fountain pens** require an array of unique tools and equipment to ensure an excellent final product. Skilled artisans use lathes for shaping and carving, as well as fine-grit sandpaper and micromesh sheets for polishing and smoothing the pen body. Precise engraving tools are also used to create distinctive designs and add a personal touch to the pen.  Tools & Equipment | Purpose   ---|---   Lathe | Shaping and carving the pen body   Sandpaper | Polishing and smoothing   Micromesh sheets | Finer polishing to achieve a glossy finish   Engraving tools | Creating designs and personalized details      **Mass-produced fountain pens** take advantage of streamlined manufacturing processes such as injection molding and extrusion molding. Injection molding involves heating and injecting pen materials into a mold, creating the pen body and other plastic parts. Extrusion molding uses a heated chamber to force material through a die, forming the pen body and ink reservoir.  Manufacturing Techniques | Purpose   ---|---   Injection molding | Creating pen body and other plastic components   Extrusion molding | Forming pen body and ink reservoir      In both handmade and mass-produced pens, assembly includes threading the pens and installing ink reservoirs, nibs, and caps. Comparing the two manufacturing approaches, it's clear that handmade pens usually involve more labor, time, and artistry, while mass-produced pens prioritize affordability and productivity.  This brief overview of the manufacturing process provides insight into the complexity and craftsmanship behind fountain pens. However, there's more to learn about other factors, such as materials and quality control, which influence the final cost and performance of these writing instruments.  ## Cost Factors  ### Influential Variables  When it comes to the cost of making a fountain pen, there are several factors that determine the price point. These include the materials used for the pen body, the size of the nib, the converter, and even the branding or name recognition associated with the pen. High-quality, durable materials like metal or resin are often more expensive compared to plastic. Gold or titanium nibs can fetch a higher cost than stainless steel ones.  The converter, which is the mechanism used to fill a pen with ink, can also impact the overall cost. More advanced or user-friendly converters can drive up the price, whereas basic ones may keep it more economical. Additionally, popular brands or pens associated with sports leagues such as the NFL or NBA can boost the value due to their name recognition and branding.  ### Cost Breakdown  Here is a brief cost breakdown for various fountain pen components in a table format:  Component | Low Cost Materials | High Cost Materials   ---|---|---   Pen Body | Plastic | Metal or Resin   Nib | Stainless Steel | Gold or Titanium   Converter | Basic Piston or Squeeze | Advanced Piston   Branding | Lesser-known Brands | Luxury or Sport      In conclusion, the cost of making a fountain pen can  …\n",

Many of them are lovingly focused on this singular item. They are in big cities and tiny towns, sometimes using the places and the natural elements around them to distinguish the style of their pens. Many of these custom fountain pen artisans have created their own materials and pushed the boundaries of machinery to offer new perspectives of what a pen can be. The commonality is that the writing instrument has been an inspiration to all of them. They are the maker and original keepers of these objects. When presented to the new keeper of the pen, the object takes on a whole new meaning. The next story begins and starts to create a secondary history that will outlast both them and the person who created it.  For someone who truly loves pens, there may be nothing more meaningful than getting to have your writing instrument customized to your every whim and will. How it looks, how it feels in your hand, and the symbolism that it might hold for you.  At Galen Leather, fountain pens are more than a hobby; they're an obsession. So it's no wonder we incorporate the ability to safely store your fountain pens into the designs of our pen cases, journal covers and pen sleeves. We even recently launched our own range of what we consider to be some of the best fountain pens available en masse that pair beautifully with our best journals for fountain pens.  ## For The Love of Custom Made Pens  On the heels of this obsession, I wanted to share some of the customer fountain pen makers that can make having a bespoke fountain pen a reality for you. We have also, in some cases, included smaller artisan makers who produce limited edition pens rather than customized pens because we felt that their contribution should be acknowledged and celebrated. It should also be noted that many of the custom pen makers may have long waiting lists or not be accepting custom orders at this time. So, it may be a good time to mention that patience is a virtue and also how exciting it can be to receive a custom fountain pen after waiting more than a year for it.  ## Custom Pen Makers From Around The World  It should also be noted that while nearly thirty pen makers and artisans are listed here, it is by no means an exhaustive list, so if you know of a maker that is not included, please put the information for contacting them in the comments and readers will be able to seek them out.  I hope you find someone’s work that speaks to you and that this article is the first step in acquiring your next heirloom.  Herewith (in mostly alphabetical order,) are the artists making some of the most unique and beautiful writing instruments around the globe.  ## 2024 Update (32 New Makers)  The world has changed so much since we last presented a list of makers in the pen world contributing new and sometimes ancient methods of crafting writing instruments. If there is a positive we can take away from the past three years it is that inspiration and innovation will not be held back by a pandemic. This second list of pen makers is proof positive that creativity can blossom during challenging times, producing some of the most beautiful and technically novel pens we’ve seen.  As with our previous list, it is by no means an exhaustive list, so if you know of a maker that is not included, please put the information for contacting them in the comments and readers will be able to seek them out.  I hope you find someone’s work that speaks to you and that this article combined with our first list of twenty-eight, is the first step in acquiring your next heirloom.  Herewith is our second list of artists making some of the most unique writing instruments around the globe.  ### 18111  www.pen.18111.com  Yoshi Nakama has been an artist all of his adult life. Having settled in NYC from Japan in the late 1970’s he became a fabricator for a prominent artist.  That artist just happened to be a fountain pen lover, something that he shared with Mr. Nakama. In 2012, he bought a lathe and produced some wood pen kits. My how far his designs have come from that time. Now made start to finish, by hand (save for the Jowo nibs,) 18111 pens are cast Alumilite resin adorned with maki-e techniques that have been translated to modern tools and materials. Roll stoppers are 3D printed in wax and cast in gold plated brass. Each blank is hand cast, turned and threaded by hand. The result is the natural world expressed in explosions of color and gilded in gold.  ### Additive Pens  www.additivepens.com  They look like science experiments, the kind that cause oohs and ahhs.  Completely 3D printed barrels are fitted with caps and grip sections that have been machined from solid rods of clear cast acrylic. They can only be eyedroppered, but this is where the magic begins. Not only do these pens hold a tremendous amount of ink, the ink becomes the star of the show as it swirls through a double helix or ribbon design. For those hesitant because stained acrylic gives them pause, Additive Pens has developed a proprietary ink resistant coating to minimize it. So, ink these away and remember that the reason you have an Additive Pen is to write with it. That is, _if you can stop staring at the extraordinary barrel long enough to._  ### Astoria  www.astoriapen.net  Trained as master toolmaker, Max Schrage spent four decades at Montblanc before starting his own fine writing instruments company. In 2009 he acquired the rights to the Astoria Pen company where he makes his David and Goliath models mostly Ebonite with the occasional additions of gold and steel. While some of the iterations are sleep and simple, others are intricate floral masterpieces that resemble fine jewelry where Schrage can really show of his masterful skillset and veteran status in the pen world.  ### Atelier Lusso  www.lussopens.com/  Eric Sand’s Atelier Lusso starts with a car. A Ferrari to be exact. One that his father took him to see: the 1964 Ferrari Lusso Coupe. To Eric, this car was a marvel of great design and engineering working together. In honor of that memorable automobile, the company name Atelier Lusso, which translates to “the luxury home studio” was chosen.

Actually, they were two models of the same pen, each made from a solid piece of painted Perspex and wires. One showed the pen as it would look with the cap on and the other one without a cap, appearance models we call it in the trade. Needless to say, the parts could not be separated and had no function, not even the clip.  It took almost three years for the \"penwright\" (me, the _ingeneer_) to not only fill the pen's interior with the parts of the pen and make it write but also, to circumnavigate the barriers (shape) the designer (_shaper_) had placed on the path of manifestation. Of course not intentionally but by naif ignorance. At your leisure, I recommend your lecture of the book about the _**Lorelei**_ sitting on a rock in the middle of the fast-flowing River Rhine. She had been totally oblivious that her appearance and singing distracted the skippers, and they collided with the many rocks. Just like that.  _There is a reason for this spelling of**ingeneer**_  Before I rattle on, in the sidebar (right) the second item from the top is the Google translator. I tried the German translation, and it turned out quite readable. Therefore, if reading English causes any trouble, try it.  §  Let's begin the journey. What is so special about Fountain Pens? As you keep on reading along, you will discover, it's a miracle that they work at all. Building something on such aloof grounds was a big hurdle to jump for an ingeneer who likes rising from a solid foundation. Did it work out? Have a read, and you will find out. (It sure did; who wants to write about something which didn't?)  Now, about this site: No stress! You won't find long tables of test results but information, you will find helpful for understanding fountain pens' function. Each topic unravels similarly. After introducing you to some general information, I continue with providing enough scientific background so that you can follow my explanations on the technical and quality details, of form and function, as well as the production of the components pertaining to this topic. Finally, a chapter will be rounded off, with a bit of discussion.  A good starting step for a novice would be from this page: _**Components of a Fountain Pen**_ (PS: coloured bold, italic text indicates a link to a place on this site if not mentioned otherwise, Wikipedia, quite often.)  Otherwise, go wild and click on any title in the **Table of Contents ⇒⇒**  How does magic enter into the design of a pen? I love my work, am passionate about it, and I highly care about the user of my product. And for now, it is my wish that you get much pleasure from reading and discovering.

Alfred   13 February, 2020 at 5:19 am  Hello Amadeus W   Please can you tell me - do you still remember if the tipping of Lamys steel nibs had been Iridium as well those days - and not just extra hardened steel as the nib in principle?   For today, you supposely cannot say for sure, but there's a debate on fountainpennetwork and elsewhere about that question which (naturally) left things open. So would you give us a clue?  Thanks in advance,  Alfred.  LikeLike  Reply       * Amadeus W   13 February, 2020 at 8:39 am  Hi Alfred   In Germany, we called it Wolfram which is tungsten. The biggest problem was its high melting point. Iridium-platinum-blends are easier to process.   I believe its more about company tradition which material a manufacturer prefers. Tungsten is the more durable material but when you consider the time frame it does not matter, really.  Ich hoffe, das ist hilfreich  Amadeus  LikeLike  Reply         * Alfred   13 February, 2020 at 9:17 pm  Danke vielmals. Ganz wunderbar erläutert.   Unter uns: Ich schreibe hier - thematisch bezogen - ebenfalls in Englisch, um eine größere Breite von Leuten zu erreichen (obwohl Deutscher von Geburt, wie aufgefallen sein müsste.) Dafür sollten meine Kenntnisse dieser Sprache genügen.   Ansonsten ist/war Lamy (das alte Lamy jedenfalls soweit es sich in seinen Produkten bis in die heutige Zeit erhalten hat) meine Lieblingsfirma und ich selbst kreativer Vielschreiber - Hobbyschriftsteller. Das erklärt manches.  Grüsse vom verregneten Olfen nach Australien!

      " Okay, based on the provided text, here’s a detailed, step-by-step manufacturing guide for a fountain pen, incorporating the information about both mass-produced and artisanal methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Manufacturing Guide: Fountain Pen**\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Material Preparation & Component Creation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Plastic Component Production (Mass-Produced):**\n",
      "    *   **Injection Molding:** Molten plastic is injected into a mold to create the pen body, ink reservoir, and other plastic parts.\n",
      "    *   **Extrusion Molding:** Heated plastic is forced through a die to form the pen body and ink reservoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Nib Creation:**\n",
      "    *   **Metal Cutting/Stamping/Machining:** Metal (gold, stainless steel, or titanium) is cut, stamped, or machined into the basic nib shape. CNC machines are used for intricate designs.\n",
      "    *   **Tipping Material Attachment:** The tipping material (metal) is attached to the nib end using welding or adhesive bonding.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Artisanal Production (Handcrafted):**\n",
      "    *   **Lathe Turning:** Resin, precious metals, or celluloid are shaped and polished using a lathe. This allows for highly customized designs and finishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Assembly (Applies to Both Mass-Produced and Artisanal Pens):**\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Threading & Reservoir Installation:** The pen barrel and cap are threaded. Ink reservoirs are installed.\n",
      "5.  **Nib Installation:** The nib is carefully fitted and secured into the pen body.\n",
      "6.  **Cap Installation:** The cap is attached to the pen body.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Adding Features & Finishing (Mass-Produced Pens - Automated Processes):**\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Groove Creation:** Features like grooves for screw-on sections, threads for screw-on caps, and decorative elements are added using automated machinery.\n",
      "8.  **Deburring:** Internal and external edges are cleaned and smoothed to remove sharp edges.\n",
      "9.  **Clip Installation:** A clip is attached to the pen body.\n",
      "10. **Window Clip Creation:** Open window clips are created.\n",
      "11. **Flat End Creation:** Flat ends are created.\n",
      "12. **Cleaning & Drying:** The pen body and cap are thoroughly cleaned and dried.\n",
      "13. **Electroplating:** Components are electroplated (often with gold or silver) for a decorative and protective finish.\n",
      "14. **Painting:** The pen bodies are painted with various colors and finishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Final Quality Control & Packaging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Inspection:** The finished pen undergoes a final inspection to ensure quality and functionality.\n",
      "16. **Packaging:** The pen is packaged for retail sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Regarding the Question about Plastic vs. Resin:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the text, here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Plastic:** Generally refers to synthetic materials created from petroleum. The manufacturing process is more standardized and often involves large-scale production.\n",
      "*   **Resin:** The text suggests resin is often a \"natural\" material (derived from trees) but undergoes processing. It’s used for creating custom designs and finishes, particularly in artisanal pens.\n",
